## How do I "make" a virtual computer?

First of all, a researcher would determine whether they need their own separate virtual computer,
or whether they can share space on an existing virtual computer (for example, one shared by a research group).

Assuming they decide to create their own, they would might request one from their institution, or they might
have an account with a commercial provider where they have full control to set up a virtual computer to suit their needs.

## How would I log on to a virtual computer?

Although it is possible to set up cloud computers with different operating systems such as Windows or MacOS,
most researchers use a Linux-type operating system (of which there are several subtypes, such as Ubuntu).
