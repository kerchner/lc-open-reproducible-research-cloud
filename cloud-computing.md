## Introduction

The majority of our researchers, outside of a few specialized fields, usually have a laptop that they use for most of their work.
When they need to work with a data set, they typically download it to their laptop and use 
some sort of data analysis software on their laptop to conduct their analysis.

## Discussion

With the person next to you, discuss:

If a researcher came to you for advice on the following questions, what advice would you give?

- "I need to analyze a data set that is too large to fit on my laptop.  What should I do?"
- "My analysis needs to run for many hours and I can't keep my laptop on for that whole time."
- "My analysis would take many days or weeks to run on my laptop"
- "The tools I need to use for my analysis need to run in a Linux environment, but I only have a Windows or Mac laptop."

## Solution

Some common answers might be:

- "I need to analyze a data set that is too large to fit on my laptop.  What should I do?"
   - Break the data up and analyze it in parts
   - Use a cloud computing provider (e.g. AWS, Google Cloud, Azure)
- "My analysis needs to run for many hours and I can't keep my laptop on for that whole time."
   - Use a cloud computing provider (e.g. AWS, Google Cloud, Azure)
- "My analysis would take many days or weeks to run on my laptop"
   - Use a cloud computing provider (e.g. AWS, Google Cloud, Azure)
- "The tools I need to use for my analysis need to run in a Linux environment, but I only have a Windows or Mac laptop."
   - Try using a virtualized environment on your laptop
   - Use a cloud computing provider (e.g. AWS, Google Cloud, Azure)

## What is cloud computing?

Cloud computing is a pivotal technology for researchers, offering
unparalleled access to vast computing resources and data storage
capabilities via the internet. For academic librarians assisting
researchers, understanding cloud computing is crucial as it enables
the efficient handling of large datasets, complex computations, and
collaborative projects. Researchers can leverage cloud services to
perform high-performance computing tasks, run sophisticated simulations,
and analyze extensive data sets without the need for substantial local
infrastructure. This technology also facilitates seamless collaboration
across institutions and geographical boundaries, fostering a more
integrated and dynamic research environment. By utilizing cloud computing,
researchers can accelerate their work, reduce costs, and enhance the
reproducibility and scalability of their studies.
This makes cloud computing an indispensable tool in advancing scientific
discovery and innovation.


## Options for cloud computing

- Institutional infrastructure (for example, institutional cluster computing)
- Public/national research infrastructure (TODO: Examples)
- Commercial services:  Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud
- Discipline-specific commercial services (TODO: Examples)

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::  challenge

## Discussion

- Does your institution have its own cloud and/or cluster computing infrastructure?
- Does your institution provide researchers with access to commercial cloud computing resources?
- How do specific research projects pay for cloud services?
